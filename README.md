Hello!
My name is Jamie Myers and I am currently a freshman at Allegheny college. One of the first questions upon meeting someone who is pursing a degree at Allegheny is "Why did you choose to come here?" For me, committing to Allegheny College was an easy decision, but the journey to a higher education was far from facile.

Born and raised in York, Pennsylvania, moving to Meadville was a simple transition from one small town to another.
