Hello!
My name is Jamie Myers and I am currently a freshman at Allegheny college. One of the first questions upon meeting someone who is pursing a degree at Allegheny is "Why did you choose to come here?" For me, committing to Allegheny College was an easy decision, but the journey to a higher education was far from facile.

Born and raised in York, Pennsylvania, moving to Meadville was a simple transition from one small town to another. As a kid growing up in the early 2000's in a lackluster city, most, if not all, forms of entertainment involved technology. Whether through MS Paint or pinball, I spent my childhood teaching myself how to use a computer and its expansively endless capabilities. Thus, growing up I always imagined myself a computer programmer or engineer rather than a firefighter or astronaut. Shifting from the Sega to computer games to the first PlayStation, Xbox, and back to computer games, I was always found playing with any software I could get my hands on. Observing and experiencing firsthand the technological advancements of the twenty-first century inspired my belief that technological development is infinitely expanding, and I pictured myself becoming a part of such a powerful movement.

Although I continued to spend any free time on the computer, my idea of entertainment shifted from playing RuneScape to downloading music on LiveWire. Music quickly enveloped my entire life, and I was never again seen without headphones and a Walkman, mp3 player, or iPod. Learning about music production increased my interest in technology even further; thus, I began educational studies of computer programming in sophomore year of high school. From tenth grade to senior year I spent most of my school days learning about different forms of coding software and becoming fluent in Java.
